## Install

Unzip
[sharefix.zip](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4098)
into your vim runtime or if you have pathogen installed you can clone
the project into your runtime.

## Help

See `:h sharefix` or
[doc/sharefix.txt](https://github.com/samiconductor/vim-sharefix/blob/master/doc/sharefix.txt)

## Companion Plugins

I recommend installing the vimerable Tim Pope's
[unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) plugin for
quickfix shortcuts.

## Tests

You will need the
[unittest](https://github.com/h1mesuke/vim-unittest) plugin to run
the tests. Use the following command to run the tests:

`:UnitTest test/test_suite.vim`

## Requirements

* vim7.3+
